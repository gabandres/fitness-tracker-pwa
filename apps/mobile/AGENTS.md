# Expo HAS CHANGED

Read the exact versioned docs at https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v54.0.0/ before writing any code (installed SDK is `expo@^54`; keep this URL in sync with `apps/mobile/package.json`).

# Entry point is NOT `expo-router/entry`

`package.json` `main` is a custom **`index.js`** at the app root. It imports
`expo-router/entry` for its side effect (routing behaves identically) and then
registers the Android home-screen widget's task handler — which must run at
module scope, before React mounts, because Android can wake the widget when the
UI was never started. Don't "fix" `main` back to `expo-router/entry`; it
silently kills the widget on Android. See `WIDGET_PLAN.md`.

# This app is in production

Treat every change here as a production change: this app is on the iOS App Store.

**Do not read a version number out of `app.json` — it is not evidence of what
shipped.** Which version is live, which build backs it, and what is merged but
not yet in any binary all live in **`STATUS.md`**, which carries the command to
re-check each one. Nothing in this folder should restate them; a second copy is
how "planned" and "shipped" became indistinguishable here before.
