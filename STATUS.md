# STATUS — what is true right now

**Updated:** 2026-07-29 · **Owns:** current state only. Not history (`CHANGELOG.md`),
not rationale (`docs/adr/`), not vocabulary (`CONTEXT.md`).

If a statement here conflicts with any other file in this repo, **this file wins** —
or the other file is stale and should be deleted. Every claim below has a
verification command; if you are about to scope work off a claim, run the command
first. Three separate times this project scoped already-shipped features as new
work because a plan doc was read as a status doc.

---

## 1. Live right now

| Surface | State | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| Web PWA `ignia.fit` | **Live**, bilingual (EN + es-PR), **105** prerendered pages (en 52 / es 53), 114-URL sitemap | `npm run build` prints both counts |
| iOS App Store | **1.0.0, build 7** (uploaded 2026-07-20, `READY_FOR_SALE`), from commit `168e0394` | ASC command below |
| iOS 1.1.0 | **Metadata shell only** — `PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION`, **no binary attached** | ASC command below |
| Android / Play | **Not launched.** No Play account, no device, no closed-test cohort | — |
| Cloud Functions / rules | Deployed, project `fitness-tracker-gb-1775407101` | `firebase deploy --only functions --dry-run` |

**The `1.1.0` trap.** `app.json` says 1.1.0 and ASC has a 1.1.0 version page, but
**EAS has never built a 1.1.0 iOS binary**. Anything a doc describes as "shipped in
1.1.0" shipped in **1.0** or has not shipped at all. Do not trust a version number
in prose; ask ASC:

```sh
node -e "import('./scripts/asc-client.mjs').then(async({api,APP_ID})=>{const r=await api('GET','/v1/apps/'+APP_ID+'/appStoreVersions?limit=5&fields[appStoreVersions]=versionString,appStoreState');r.data.forEach(v=>console.log(v.attributes.versionString,v.attributes.appStoreState))})"
```

## 2. Written, merged, and in **no** binary

All of this is on `main` and reaches nobody until the next iOS build. Do not
re-scope it as new work; do not describe it to users as available.

- **Home-screen widget**, iOS (SwiftUI, `apps/mobile/targets/widget/index.swift`)
  and Android (TSX). Never compiled, never rendered anywhere — no device, no
  simulator. Highest-risk item in the next binary.
- **Health activity import** (steps / active energy → `dailyActivity`). Import +
  display only; deliberately does **not** feed measured-mode TDEE.
- **Per-meal reminder settings** (fixes the un-silenceable 1:30pm lunch nudge).
- **In-app rating prompt** (`84898243`).
- **Date localization** — dates followed the phone's locale, not the app's, so a
  Spanish user saw English weekday and month names throughout (`5028a9e8`).
- **Weigh-in outlier rejection** — one stray reading could rewrite the whole weight
  trend and drag the measured target to the floor (`946e7250`).
- **The Refine Targets catch** (`4f91b1f0`). Only the client half is pending: the
  `dailyWeights` index that commit added is *deployed*, and it already repaired
  Refine Targets for users on 1.0 without an app update.

Verify anything in this list with `git log 168e0394..HEAD -- <path>` — that range is
exactly "merged since the live binary". For a single commit, the sharper test is
`git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> 168e0394` (exit 0 = it is *in* the live binary).

**Three items were wrongly listed here on 2026-07-29** and are called out so the
mistake is not re-made: the **recipe-URL import UI**, the **mobile verify-email
gate** (`a0049b84`), and **the App Review fixes from the two 1.0 rejections**
(`97662575`, `eb922813`, `04f30dcc`) are all **in 1.0**. The last of those is
provable without git: 1.0 is `READY_FOR_SALE`, and it only got there by passing the
review those commits fixed.

## 3. The binding constraint: iOS builds

- iOS cannot be built on this machine. Windows, no Xcode. There is no local path.
- iOS builds come from **EAS cloud, free tier**: 15 iOS builds/month, low-priority
  queue, 1 concurrent, 45-minute timeout.
- **iOS is 15/15 — exhausted. Measured 2026-07-29 from the API, not from a doc.**
  Android is 8/15. The billing period is **2026-07-01 → 2026-08-01**, so the reset
  is **2026-08-01** and nothing changes it. Do not start an iOS build before then;
  it will be refused, and the queue position is not the constraint, the counter is.

```sh
cd apps/mobile && npx eas-cli account:usage gabandres --non-interactive
```

  That command is the only authoritative source — `build:list` counts builds
  *started*, which over-counts (it includes errored builds) and cannot show the
  limit or the period boundary. It is easy to miss because it does not appear in
  `eas-cli --help`, which lists only the `account` topic.
- Android **does** build locally and free, via Gradle directly — *not* through
  `eas build --local`, which refuses to run on Windows. See §6.
- Budget **two** builds for the next release: one `development` for device QA, one
  `production`. Shipping never-executed Swift straight to review is how the last two
  rejections happened, and each rejection cost a build anyway.

```sh
cd apps/mobile && npx eas-cli build:list --platform ios --limit 5   # what exists
```

## 4. Open work, and what each is actually blocked on

| # | Work | Blocked on |
|---|---|---|
| — | Next iOS binary (everything in §2) | EAS quota reset **2026-08-01** (verified 07-29: iOS 15/15), then 2 builds |
| #36 | Verify the shipped widget on a physical iPhone | the build above; owner's iPhone |
| #46 | Read the watch layouts on a simulator | **a Mac with Xcode** (currently: borrow one) |
| #47 | Compile the generated watch targets in Xcode | **a Mac with Xcode**; branch `probe/watch-compile-47` stages it |
| — | App Store screenshots | owner, on device (`store-assets/README.md`) |
| — | Play launch | Play account + 12 testers × 14 consecutive days |

**Apple glanceable surfaces (map #31).** 13 of its 16 tickets are **closed** — the
transport, staleness, layouts, tap targets, review surface and sign-out privacy are
all decided. What remains is #36/#46/#47 above. No watch Swift exists yet;
`apps/mobile/targets/` contains only `widget` (the stubs were removed in `f4f03f38`
until the work starts). "Mostly done" describes the deciding, not the building.

## 5. Decided and deliberately not happening

Do not re-propose these without new information; the reasoning is in the linked ADR
or research note.

- **Pro tier / IAP / Stripe** — dormant, flag-gated off. v1 is free. (ADR-0015)
- **AI photo-scan** — deferred to a paid tier; runtime cost gate. (ADR-0015)
- **App Intents / Siri Shortcuts** — decided **no** for this batch, 2026-07-23.
- **Watch app reading Firestore directly** — structurally unavailable; no watchOS
  Firestore client. (`docs/research/watch-complication-transport.md`)
- **Activity feeding measured-mode TDEE** — would double-count. Formula mode only.
- **Shared subscription cache in mobile** — per-hook subscriptions are intentional.
  (ADR-0016)
- **A 4th scheduled Cloud Function** — Cloud Scheduler's free 3 jobs are spent; fold
  into `hourly-tasks.ts`.

## 6. App Store submission — standing rules

Carried over from the two 1.0 rejections. These are permanent, not a checklist to
do once.

- **Accounts are Individual, not an entity** — Apple Developer Individual ($99/yr,
  no D-U-N-S) and Play Individual ($25 one-time), decided 2026-07-07 after dropping
  the Wyoming-LLC plan. The owner's legal name shows publicly as seller. Known
  accepted risk: guideline 5.1.1(ix) prefers a legal entity for health apps that
  touch HealthKit; enforcement is inconsistent and a reviewer *can* raise it.
- **Always hand Apple `review@ignia.fit`** in the Demo Account fields — it is
  pre-verified and seeded. A fresh account is walled out by the email-verification
  gate, and 2.1 demo-account failures are Apple's largest rejection bucket. Never
  point them at `demo@ignia.fit` (screenshots only). Confirm it can still write
  before submitting.
- **Notes for Review must name the specific changes.** Generic text gets rejected
  under 2.3.1.
- **`supportsTablet` stays `false`.** Apple reviews on iPad anyway (that is how the
  1.0 layout clipping surfaced), but flipping it true obliges an iPad design pass
  *and* iPad screenshots — more rejection surface, not less.
- **Keep `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`** even though photo-scan is unreachable:
  `expo-image-picker` is still linked, and a *missing* purpose string is an
  automated ITMS-90683 rejection. An extra one is never punished.
- **Privacy labels must match reality** — health data + email, no Photos.

## 7. Commands that answer questions faster than reading

```sh
npm start                  # web dev (emulators: npm run dev)
npm test                   # web unit tests
npm --prefix packages/core test
cd apps/mobile && npx expo start

# Android release APK on Windows (free, unlimited):
cd apps/mobile && npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install
cd android && ./gradlew.bat assembleRelease --no-daemon \
  -Pandroid.injected.signing.store.file=<abs path to credentials/dev.keystore> ...
```

`npx expo prebuild -p ios` also runs on Windows and is free — it proves the Xcode
project *generates*. It cannot prove anything compiles or signs.

## 8. Where things live (and what gets deleted)

| Question | File |
|---|---|
| What is this repo, how do I work in it | `CLAUDE.md` |
| What does this word mean | `CONTEXT.md` |
| **What is true right now** | **this file** |
| Why is it built this way | `docs/adr/` |
| What shipped, when | `CHANGELOG.md` (+ `CHANGELOG-archive.md`) |
| What did we research | `docs/research/` — each file opens with its verdict |
| What's still wrong in the UX | `UX_AUDIT.md` |
| Store listing field values | `docs/app-store-metadata.md` |
| Machine-local credential paths | `CLAUDE.local.md` (git-ignored) |

**The rule that keeps this from happening again: a plan document is deleted the day
its work ships.** Its outcome belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`, its reasoning in an ADR, its
current state here. Git keeps the original forever; `git log --diff-filter=D
--name-only` finds it. Never leave a shipped plan in the tree with a "CORRECTION"
block on top — that is how a status doc and a wish list become indistinguishable.
